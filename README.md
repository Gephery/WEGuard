# World Explorer Guard
Not my finest plugin, pretty much a disc based plugin. Although I did get to do some cool things with defining regions and maping areas.
Also one of my early projects that I did not come back and refactor, so don't judge. But feel free to imporve on the idea, and make some
classes, java is object oriented programming language so make some of it a little more java like.

This has some api exposed and feel free to commit to a new branch and help me out. 
But do not take this and use it as your own, please. I am a strong beliver open source, 
so if you use the API in this project do make your own project open source at some point.
