# World Explorer Guard
I did some refactoring on this one, but still not great. Some cool ideas are in here, the chat is lacking lots, use CCAPI from Jmbannon it is open source.

This has some api exposed and feel free to commit to a new branch and help me out. 
But do not take this and use it as your own, please. I am a strong beliver open source, 
so if you use the API in this project do make your own project open source at some point.
